Get data from a collection in Firebase Cloud Firestore and show it as a browser alert.   

The code only works as a Chrome browser extension for now, and due to my low level of expertise coding it might be unoptimized. 
You can use it as a guide for your project in case you need it, but I DO NOT recommend any user to use it directly as an extension. It is completely safe to use, but as I said, there are many things that could be improved.
